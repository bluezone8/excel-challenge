### SOFTWARE CHOICE

Excel was the chosen software for anayzing the data for a number of reasons
1. The scope and volume of the data is small.  Thus, the analysis could be accomplished much easier and efficiently without writing code
2. The ubiquitous install base of Excel ensures that most parties wishing to view the analsis will be able to do so.
3.  The analysis tools of Excel (both caluculation and charting) facilitated analysis of these type of data.

### DISCUSSION
The analysis yielded some interesting information related to the KickStarter campaigns.
